Bloomberg Terminal is a key tool for many people in financial markets. They use its
functionalities daily and rely on its efficiency and correctness. Bloomberg Terminal has more
than forty thousand functions which displays news, stock markets information, financial
analysis and many other things. 
Since you now know a few things about the Terminal now, we’d like you to implement a Mini
Bloomberg Terminal! We of course won’t expect you to implement all 40,000 functions
available on the Terminal, we’re only interested in the backend part of a few functions listed
below:

1. USER - users profile page
2. NEWS - news stories page
3. CALENDAR - a calendar with appointments
4. FX - an foreign exchange function*
5. STOCK - an information page about given security

Each functionality behaves like a separate set of functions (Could be compared to different
websites within one Web browser). You don’t need to worry about how they are joined
together, since that would be done on a UI side. For now just create the implementation for
the functions defined in each Mini Bloomberg Terminal functionality.
